# Fake Vim
## Should you care?
No.
## So why?
Because I need some work to show. I always do super small projects, but no one cares about these. (Neither do I.)


## Configuration
This is extremely limited, but I want to make it work as soon as possible.
```~/.config/fakeVim.conf```

### Dependencies
```curses.h```
