# Fake Vim
## Should you care?
No.
## So why?
Because I need some work to show. I always do super small projects, but no one cares about these. (Neither do I.)

## Functionality
- move cursor  
- log errors  
- config file

## Configuration
This is extremely limited, but I want to make it work as soon as possible.
`~/.config/fakeVim.conf`  
You do it just like this:  
```
empty _
cursor x
up k
down j
left h
right l
```

there will be comments in future, I dont care about that too much now

### Dependencies
```curses.h```
